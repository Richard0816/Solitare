# Solitare
This is an algorithm that plays the windows solitaire. It takes a scan of the screen to understand the state of the board and stores the state in a list that it can then look up The algorithm boils down to a list of if statements and a while loop until the board has been solved. Using the library pyautogui, I can let it have full control over the mouse and thus solve most easy solitaire boards. The algorithm is under the file algo and the other files are images that the algorithm uses to identify numbers and suits.
